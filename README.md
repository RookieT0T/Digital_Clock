# **Digital Clock Design**
This is a digital clock design, which supports the display of two different time, using <mode> signal to decide which time to show on the 8-segment displays. Users could use <nextP0>, <nextP1>, and <add> signal, signals originally generated by pressing buttons, to correctly set second, minute, and hour of the clock after reset.

## Arithmetic Part ##
The design integrates the designs of ripple carry adders and carry-lookahead adders.

## 8-Segment Display Logic ##
The 8-segment displays of the Altera FPGA board with EP4CE10F17C8 chip in Cyclone Ⅳ Series are designed based on dynamic scanning methodology. To show different numbers on the different displays simultaneously, the logic of showing numbers on a 8-segment display 1ms per time is designed.
